  {@TppBackgroundPrintManager

    Use the BackgroundPrintManager to handle the background printing process. Call
    the manager's Print method passing a TppProducer descendent and a
    properly confired TppPageRequest object. This starts the background print
    process.

    Before closing an application, which is generating reports in a background
    thread, check the gBackgroundPrintManager global object in the
    ppBackgroundPrintManager unit. Evaluate the value of
    gBackgroundPrintManager.QueueSize if it is non-zero in
    order to create a message to notify the user that there are still reports
    which are being generated in a background thread.

    Use the OnThreadTerminated event to listen when a report has finished
    printing in the background thread. Check the QueueSize
    property to determine if no more background thread request are left to be
    executed in a background thread.

    When a report should be printed in the background, pass the report object to
    the print method of the gBackgroundPrintManager global object in this unit.
    The print method also should receive the current PageRequest from the print
    dialog.}

  {@TppBackgroundPrintManager.OnAllThreadsTerminated

    Use this event to be notified that there are no more background print jobs
    to be processed. All the threads have Terminatedd execution.}

  {@TppBackgroundPrintManager.OnException

    If an exception is raised in the background print thread during creation
    of the container, this event will fire when the thread is terminating.
    The default behavior is that a message box is displayed showing the
    exception class of the exception which was handled and the message of
    that exception. If this event is assigned, then the message box will
    not be displayed. Most likely, the container form or datamodule is not
    threadsafe and needs to be made thread safe before printing the report
    in a background thread. An exception is passed in the event which
    includes the message information of the original exception.}

  {@TppBackgroundPrintManager.OnThreadTerminated

    Use this event in order to be notified when the each indivisual background
    print job has been processed and sent to the selected device. Use this
    event to get feedback about the progress when multiple reports are being
    generated in the background.}

  {@TppBackgroundPrintManager.QueueSize

    Read this property in order to determine how many background print requests
    remain in the queue to be processed, generated and ultimately sent to the
    device. The background printing queue is FIFO.}

  {@TppBackgroundPrintManager.ThreadPriority

    Set this property at runtime in order to increase the priority that background
    print threads use. The lowest setting is recommended in order to have the best
    performance from the main application while the background thread is
    executing.

    This is a pass through to the thread's Priority property when the background
    thread is instantiated.}
