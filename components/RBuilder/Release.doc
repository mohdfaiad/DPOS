\par
\pard\nowidctlpar\b\fs28 TeeChart Support\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\tx360\par
\pard\nowidctlpar\b\fs28 Prior installations\par
\b0\fs24 The installation program will automatically detect and delete any existing version of ReportBuilder for Delphi 7 installed on your system.  The entire root directory in which ReportBuilder is installed will be deleted.  It is therefore imperative that you backup any custom work that may reside in this directory before installing this version. The default install directory is now:\par
\par
\pard\nowidctlpar\li720 $(DELPHI)\\RBuilder\par
\pard\nowidctlpar\par
This directory is used regardless of whether you are installing ReportBuilder Standard, Professional, or Enterprise.\par
\par
\pard\nowidctlpar\tx360\f0\fs32 Delphi 7 Release Notes:\b\fs24\par
\f1\fs28\par
1. dbExpress support\par
\b0\fs24\par
ReportBuilder can be used with the dbExpress TSQLClientDataSet component. ReportBuilder does NOT support undirectional datasets and therefore cannot be used with TSQLDataSet, TSQLQuery, TSQLStoredProc, and TSQLTable.\par
\par
When using a TSQLClientDataSet with a ReportBuilder report, simply connect a DBPipeline to a standard Delphi DataSource component.\par
\par
In order to use the query tools available in the Data workspace of the Report Designer, the Designer component must be configured as shown in the end-user database example in: ...\\RBuilder\\Demos\\EndUser Databases\\Interbase\\dbExpress.\par
\par
\b\fs28 2. Issues with Frames\f0\fs20\par
\b0\f1\fs24\par
Frames (TFrame) in Delphi are containers that enable collections of components to be visually configured and re-used. Unlike form inheritance, however, Delphi does not permit new components to be added to frame descendants (i.e. frames embedded on forms or other frames). \par
\par
Therefore, if a Report object is placed on a frame, the report layout must be maintained entirely in the top level ancestor. You cannot access a form containing the frame and add report components, nor can new report layouts be loaded from templates. \par
\par
ReportBuilder's DBPipeline and BDEPipeline components cannot currently be used with frames. Both of these components automatically create Field components (i.e. AutoCreateFields) when a dataset is opened. This behavior will cause access violations if a data pipeline is placed in a descendant frame.\par
\par
\f0\fs32\par
Installation Notes\b\fs20\par
\b0\par
\cf1\b\f1\fs28 1. Install ReportBuilder\f0\fs20\par
\b0\f1\fs24 The installation program will copy files into the ...\\RBuilder directory, add the ReportBuilder components to a 'RBuilder' tab of the Delphi component palette, install the ReportBuilder help into the Delphi help system, and install TeeChart support (if you have TeeChart installed). \par
\par
If after installing ReportBuilder and launching Delphi, you do not see the RBuilder tab on the Delphi component palette, access the Component | Install Packages menu option, go to the bottom of the package list, and check each of the ReportBuilder packages.  If the packages are already checked, access the Component | Configure Palette\'85 menu option and move the RBuilder tab up the list, positioning it right before the 'Data Controls' tab.  This will allow you to see the RBuilder tab without scrolling right on the Delphi component palette.\par
\f0\par
\b\f1\fs28 2. Review the on-line help\f0\fs20\par
\b0\f1\fs24 If it appears that ReportBuilder is not installed correctly, use the information in the on-line help to troubleshoot your installation.  The on-line help is located in the RBuilder.hlp file in the RBuilder\\Help directory.  From the table of contents, select 'Installing ReportBuilder'.\par
\b\f0  \par
\f1\fs28 3. Convert Reports\f0\fs20\par
\b0\f1\fs24 ReportBuilder will convert reports that were created with previous versions. Please back-up your existing reports before beginning the conversion process.  Reports converted to the current version will not be useable by previous versions of ReportBuilder.\par
\par
The first time you open your reports, a conversion routine will run, assigning the values of discontinued properties to their new counterparts.  Simply opening and closing a form (and saying Yes to the Save Changes? dialog) is enough to convert the reports contained therein to the current format.  If you have reports in RTM files, load the RTMs into a report object at Delphi design-time and then save the RTM to file. Due to the nature of the conversion routine, it will take at least 1-2 seconds for the routine to run when converting reports created with a version previous to ReportBuilder 4.0.\par
